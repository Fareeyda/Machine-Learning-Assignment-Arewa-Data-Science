The test of the sentiment will be to compare it to the reviewer's score for the same review. For instance, if the sentiment thinks the negative review had a sentiment of 1 (extremely positive sentiment) and a positive review sentiment of 1, but the reviewer gave the hotel the lowest score possible, then either the review text doesn't match the score, or the sentiment analyser could not recognize the sentiment correctly. You should expect some sentiment scores to be completely wrong, and often that will be explainable, e.g. the review could be extremely sarcastic \"Of course I LOVED sleeping in a room with no heating\" and the sentiment analyser thinks that's positive sentiment, even though a human reading it would know it was sarcasm."
