    "    1982 Recurrent Neural Networks are artificial neural networks derived from feedforward neural networks that create temporal graphs."

    " The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence\n",
    " was a seminal event in the history of artificial intelligence (AI).\n",
    " It was a six-week workshop held at Dartmouth College in the summer \n",
    " of 1956, and it brought together researchers from a variety of fields\n",
    " to explore the possibility of creating machines that could perform tasks\n",
    " traditionally associated with human intelligence.\n",
    " The workshop was organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel\n",
    " Rochester, and Claude Shannon, and it included participants such as \n",
    " Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Arthur Samuel. The group set out\n",
    " to explore topics such as problem solving, language processing, and machine learning,\n",
    " among others.The workshop was significant because it marked the beginning of the field \n",
    " of AI as a distinct discipline"

    "#1956 - 1974: \"The golden years\"\n",
    " The period between 1956 and 1974 is often referred to as\n",
    " \"the golden years\" of artificial intelligence (AI). During\n",
    " this time, significant progress was made in the development\n",
    " of AI technologies and the field began to mature as a distinct\n",
    " area of research.\n",
    " One of the major achievements of this period was the development\n",
    " of the first AI programs. In 1956, the Logic Theorist, developed\n",
    " by Allen Newell and J. C. Shaw, became the first program to prove \n",
    " mathematical theorems. This was followed by the development of other\n",
    " pioneering AI programs, such as the General Problem Solver (GPS) and the SAINT (Symbolic Automatic INTegrator).\n",
    " However, the optimism of the golden years began to wane in the 1970s. Progress in AI began to slow down, and\n",
    " researchers began to realize that many of the challenges they faced were more difficult than initially thought.\n",
    " The limitations of the available hardware and lack of funding also contributed to the slowdown.\n",
    " This led to what is known as the \"AI winter,\" a period of reduced funding and interest in AI research that lasted  \n",
    " from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s."

    "  By the mid 1970s, it had become apparent that the complexity\n",

    "  1. Limitations. Compute power was too limited.\n",
    "  2. Combinatorial explosion. The amount of parameters needed to be trained grew exponentially as more was asked of computers, without a parallel evolution of compute power and capability.\n",
    "  3. Paucity of data. There was a paucity of data that hindered the process of testing, developing, and refining algorithms.\n",
    "  4. Are we asking the right questions?. The very questions that were being asked began to be questioned. Researchers began to field criticism about their approaches:"
