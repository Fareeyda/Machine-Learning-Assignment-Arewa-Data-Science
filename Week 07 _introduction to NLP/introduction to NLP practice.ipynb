    "This is possible because someone wrote a computer program to do this. A few decades ago, some science fiction writers predicted that people would mostly speak to their computers, and the computers would always understand exactly what they meant. Sadly, it turned out to be a harder problem that many imagined, and while it is a much better understood problem today, there are significant challenges in achieving 'perfect' natural language processing when it comes to understanding the meaning of a sentence. This is a particularly hard problem when it comes to understanding humour or detecting emotions such as sarcasm in a sentence."

However, while Eliza could parse a sentence and identify certain grammatical constructs and keywords so as to give a reasonable answer, it could not be said to understand the sentence. If Eliza was presented with a sentence following the format \"I am sad\" it might rearrange and substitute words in the sentence to form the response \"How long have you been sad\"."

If Eliza could not identify a keyword that it had a response for, it would instead give a random response that could be applicable to many different statements. Eliza could be easily tricked, for instance if a user wrote \"You are a bicycle\" it might respond with \"How long have I been a bicycle?\", instead of a more reasoned response."
